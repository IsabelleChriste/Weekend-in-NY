* Imagine you just finished your visit to the Central Park Zoo and you want a coffee or a tea. From the list shown, you can filter how far you are willing to walk to get your hot beverage. Options are : Short walk, Farther away, Longer distance and Give me all the options again.
* Click on the radio button and the list will change accordingly. 
* Once you found the place you want to go to, you can search for artsy places around that location by clicking on the neighborhood underneath the title's location under the third column : Places to go. 
* You can delete the artsy places by clicking on the reset button. 
* If the neighbourhood is wrong, an error message appears.
